# MPFM-python
The script was made to take the .log files from the MPFM unit of roxar meters and add it to the dataframe of pandas then perform some computation on it and generate a graph to ensure that the data needed for the summary are stable or not.
If the data are not stable then its advised to change the start point n and end point m to get a stable period of reading so the average values are as best as possible.
